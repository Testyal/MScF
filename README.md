# MScF
An implementation of Monadic Stream Functions of the 2016 paper [Functional Reactive Programming, Refactored](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxip1/papers/2016-HaskellSymposium-Perez-Barenz-Nilsson-FRPRefactored-short.pdf) in Scala.

Loosely inspired by the paper's related project [Dunai](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai)

## Goals
Basically I just want to make a small FRP library for the event system in Minecraft modding.
